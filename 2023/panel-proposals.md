All panel proposals are published here, so everyone can comment and make suggestions on the various proposals.
The deadline for comments is September 15th. You can comment by submitting an email to [callforpaper@archeofoss.org](mailto:callforpaper@archeofoss.org). Comments may be shared with panel proponents and members of the scientific committee.

## 1. Tools, objectives, users: state of art and future perspectives on the sharing of open data in archaeology

- **Proponents**:
  - [Valeria Boi](mailto:valeria.boi@cultura.gov.it), (MiC – Istituto Centrale per l’Archeologia)
  - [Mirella Serlorenzi](mailto:mirella.serlorenzi@cultura.gov.it),  (MiC – SSABAP-RM)

The panel aims to develop considerations about the methodological tools and the consequences of the Data Opening in archaeology, since the newly started experience of the on-line publication of the National Geoportal for Archaeology, and from other consolidated and already ongoing experiences in Italy (for example, the SITAR project, of the Special Superintendency of Rome, the MOD designed by the University of Pisa, more recently the ArcheoDB of Emilia Romagna, to name just a few).
Approaching balances, prospectives and an exam of the various criticisms, the panel intends to trace a sort of “roadmap”, considering the main issues about the Open Data raised by the sector operators, which will be useful for future developments:

Who is useful to the Open Data in archaeology? Which is the added value for their accessibility online, without discrimination?
Is it necessary to share also the original scientific documentation in addition to the basic data? What level of detail is desirable, both for the representation of the data and for their description? How can shared vocabularies make it easier to find and compare data?
How is it possible to balance the exigence of enhancing the authors’ rights with that of the data validation by an Istitution? In this sense, an in-depth reflection on the structure and role of metadata is desirable.
In a world now used to the real-time updating of the information, is a dynamic archaeological map, constantly updated with new findings or with new adjourned interpretations, concretely achievable or is it just utopic?
Which is the sustainable way to trace properly a circular knowledge path? And how can the adoption of shared standards be extended at national level, to improve the data quality and compare and spread them as best? How is it possible to reconcile the need for a central collection point with the specificities of other existing projects?
