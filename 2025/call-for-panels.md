The 19th edition of ArcheoFOSS will be hosted at University of Insubria.

This edition will be based on **panel sessions** that provide an opportunity for expert panel members to present their views and share their experience on a specific topic and then engage in a discussion with the audience.

We are welcoming original proposals from both community members and external scholars or professionals willing to discuss research questions and experience and stimulate further discussion of specific topics.

As well-known, the ArcheoFOSS conference is traditionally focused on the dissemination of archaeological projects following the Open Science paradigm:  Free Libre and Open Source methodology both for investigation and dissemination. Topics include only Free Libre and Open Source Software and Hardware in Archeology.
Panellists, therefore, should clearly state how their proposal meets one or more of the following topics:

- Use and reuse of open software in archaeology.
- Bioarcheology.
- Software and hardware applied to biological remains.
- Gamification in Archeology.
- Ethics, sustainability and regulatins.
- Reflections on communication in archaeology: theory, methods and case studies.
- AI applications in archaeology.
- Free Libre and Open Source Big Data.
- Public archaeology: theory and methods.
- AI applications in Archaeology.

A **typical panel session** starts with a **brief introduction** by the panel chair, followed by the presentations of **three or four panellists**.
Panels with at least 3 interventions should be considered prioritized.

Proposals for panels can be submitted by one or two researchers. Each complete proposal must include:

- A **title** describing the contents
- A brief **description** of the proposed specific research topic (max. 2.000 characters, spaces included), containing the state-of-art, at least one research question on which papers will be called and possibly a recent bibliography.
- One illustrative **image**, landscape orientation, with a minimal width of 2000px.
- Full name(s), affiliation(s) and email addressed (**max 2 proponents**)

Proposals for panels **must** fully comply with the ArcheoFOSS mission, regarding free and open source software or hardware, open processes, open data, open science in the archaeological or more generally in the heritage domain.

Proposals must be submitted via email, at [callforpaper@archeofoss.org](mailto:callforpaper@archeofoss.org) before **August 17 2025**, and must be licensed as CC-BY.

A maximum of **10 panels** will be accepted.
