# Available panels

## From Low-Cost to Cutting-Edge: Photogrammetry, NeRF and Gaussian Splatting for DigitalArchaeology
### Proponents
  - Daniele Bursich [](mailto:), Università degli studi di Milano Dipartimento di Beni Culturali e Ambientali, Italy, Milano
  - Lorenzo Zamboni [](mailto:), Università degli studi di Milano Dipartimento di Beni Culturali e Ambientali, Italy, Milano
### Description
In recent years, 3D acquisition techniques applied to cultural heritage have undergone unprecedented development. Alongside traditional photogrammetry, which has become a consolidated standard in archaeological documentation, new AI-based methodologies are emerging—most notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting—capable of generating dense point clouds and high-fidelity 3D models from photographic and video datasets, even when non-calibrated. At the same time, the availability of low-cost tools (consumer drones, 360° cameras, tablets with integrated LiDAR sensors) and open-source software (COLMAP, Instant-NGP, Open3D, Nerfstudio, Meshroom) opens new perspectives for fast, accessible, and economically sustainable documentation.
This panel aims to explore this hybrid landscape by bringing together researchers and practitioners who adopt low-cost, open-source, and AI-driven pipelines for archaeological documentation and interpretation. Field experiences, technological challenges, opportunities for standardization, and the broader impact of these methods on open science and the sharing of 3D data will be discussed.
The objective is to provide an updated overview of the possibilities and limitations of a “democratized” approach to 3D scanning in archaeology, and to identify shared guidelines and potential interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists, archaeologists, and the open-source community.

## Intelligenza Artificiale e Coding per l’Archeologia dell’Architettura: nuove metodologie di analisi degli elevati
### Proponent
  - Andrea Fiorini, [andrea.fiorini6@unibo.it](mail-to:andrea.fiorini6@unibo.it) - Dipartimento di Storia Culture Civiltà, Università di Bologna
### Description:
L’archeologia dell’architettura sta vivendo una trasformazione con l’integrazione di Intelligenza Artificiale (AI) e coding. Queste tecnologie consentono di accelerare la documentazione e l’interpretazione delle murature storiche, riducendo tempi e aumentando l’oggettività. Sono già stati sperimentati algoritmi di clustering applicati a nuvole di punti 3D per distinguere fasi costruttive, reti neurali per segmentare immagini di paramenti e dedurre cronologie, modelli di deep learning integrati con fotogrammetria UAV per rilevare degradi, nonché reti neurali profonde capaci di individuare tessiture omogenee su rilievi laser-scan di grande scala. Questi esempi dimostrano come l’AI possa supportare rilievo e classificazione.

Nonostante tali progressi, rimangono questioni aperte. La sfida è quindi integrare le tecniche AI nel workflow tradizionale mantenendo centrale il controllo dell’esperto e il rigore della documentazione autoptica. Il panel intende approfondire tali temi, ponendo domande come: in che modo AI e coding possono essere integrati efficacemente nella documentazione e analisi dell’architettura, migliorando la comprensione della storia costruttiva? L’obiettivo è avviare un dibattito che unisca innovazione e rigore scientifico, delineando lo stato dell’arte e le prospettive future di questo settore emergente.

## Open Remote and Proximal Sensing for Archaeology: standards, quality, interoperability and reproducible FLOSS workflows
Giuseppe Guarino, guarino.archeo@gmail.com (Alma Mater Studiorum – University of Bologna)
Gabriele Ciccone, gabriele.ciccone@cnr.it (CNR-ISPC)
The use of Free/Libre and Open-Source Software in remote and proximal sensing has expanded
significantly in archaeology, supporting activities ranging from data acquisition (satellite, UAV,
terrestrial sensors) to processing, analysis, and visualization. Yet, despite the widespread adoption of
open tools, substantial heterogeneity persists in data models, terminologies, metadata standards,
licensing choices, and dissemination practices. These discrepancies often limit comparability between
projects, hinder reproducibility of results, and reduce the potential for long-term data reuse.
This panel aims to stimulate a methodological discussion on how FLOSS can best support transparent,
interoperable, and reusable research workflows in remote and proximal sensing for archaeology. We
propose focusing on three main axes:
1. Open methods and protocols for assessing the effectiveness of data collection,
including indicators such as, accuracy, repeatability, and bias.
2. Data schemas and FAIR principles, addressing how data and metadata can be
structured to enhance interoperability, accessibility, and long-term reusability.
3. Design and evaluation of FLOSS workflows, from fieldwork to publication, with
specific attention to traceability, versioning, and transparency, highlighting best practices and shared
solutions.
A further theme concerns the role of open AI and machine learning applications in the detection of
archaeological features and patterns from remote and proximal sensing data. We invite contributions
that provide clearly documented procedures, openly available data and code, and results that can be
meaningfully compared across projects. Both methodological papers and applied case studies,
whether from field campaigns or laboratory settings, are welcome, provided they emphasize
openness, reproducibility, and the advancement of shared practices in the archaeological use of
FLOSS for remote and proximal sensing.


## Casting the Net Wide: Open Network Approaches in Italian Archaeology
Description
In recent years, archaeology has witnessed a "relational turn," where the focus has shifted from
entities in isolation to the relationships that connect them (cf. Peeples 2019; Brughmans 2023).
Network science provides a powerful formal framework to investigate these relationships, allowing
us to model and analyze complex systems such as exchange routes, settlement patterns, social
interactions, and the diffusion of ideas. While this approach has gained significant traction
internationally, its application within Italian archaeology remains fragmented. This session aims to
address this gap by showcasing the breadth and depth of network-based research applied to the rich
and diverse Italian archaeological record.
The session strongly aligns with the core ethos of ArcheoFOSS, emphasizing the critical link
between advanced computational methods and the principles of Open Science. We believe that the
future of archaeological network analysis depends on transparency in data, methods, and software.
Therefore, we particularly welcome contributions that explicitly detail their open-source workflows,
from data acquisition and network construction to analysis and visualization. As Brughmans et al
(2024) argue, the replicability of our research is paramount for building cumulative knowledge.
We invite papers that address, but are not limited to, the following topics:
● Exchange and Interaction Networks: Analysis of material culture distribution (e.g.,
ceramics, obsidian, metals) to reconstruct ancient trade and social ties.
● Spatial and Settlement Networks: GIS-based network models to investigate mobility,
settlement hierarchies, and the structuring of ancient landscapes (e.g., Roman road systems,
prehistoric pathways).
● Social and Symbolic Networks: Reconstruction of social relationships from funerary
contexts, epigraphic evidence, or iconographic similarities.
● Methodological Challenges and Innovations: Discussions on network modeling from
incomplete archaeological data, temporal network analysis, multi-layer networks, and the
integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches.
● Open Tools and Data: Presentations focusing on the use and development of FOSS tools
(e.g., R libraries like igraph, Python libraries like NetworkX, or software like Gephi and
QGIS) and the creation of FAIR datasets for network analysis.


## Integrated FLOS Ecosystems for Archaeology: from Sensor Co-designing and Data Analysis to Immersive Storytelling
Proposers

● Proposer 2: Roberto Taglioretti, LabDig 3A Academy, r.taglioretti@labdig3a.it
Description
Archaeological research and communication often operate on two separate domains: on one side,
scientific tools for data gathering and analysis (Apollonio et al. 2018; Richards 2023; Hnila et al.
2025); on the other, platforms for dissemination (Nikolakopoulou and Koutsabasis, n.d.). This panel
explores a holistic paradigm relying on entirely FLOS ecosystems, where scientific research and
communication are not distinct phases, but an integrated and transparent flow (Forte 2014; Prokakis
2022). Discussion will be based in two interconnected pillars:
1. Methodology and Scientific Tools: Approaches based on open software and hardware for the
entire datum life cycle will be analyzed, such as:
• co-design and modification of sensors (e.g., VLF, 3D cameras) for specific research needs;
• use of FLOS software for the processing of complex data, such as point clouds, for
stratigraphic and osteological study (Adams et al. 2004; Cavalazzi 2024).
The aim is to showcase how an open approach allows an unprecedented control on datum and
fosters scientific reproducibility (Fortunato and Galassi 2021).
2. Storytelling and Cultural Mediation: We will illustrate how this rigorous scientific data flows
into dynamic storytelling platforms. Moving beyond the model of "virtual tours" or gamification
as an end in itself, these tools allow for the construction of a "documentary 4.0" (Podara et al.
2021; Sun and Ch’ng 2025). Archaeologists, guides and teachers use them in real time to build an
interactive narrative, adapted to the audience and often in dialogue with physical artifacts
present, transforming the lesson or presentation into an immersive and non-linear experience.
The research question guiding the panel is: How can a methodological approach entirely based on
FLOS ecosystems – integrating hardware design, software analysis, and dynamic storytelling platforms
– transform and unify the archaeological workflow, from field research to real-time cultural mediation?

DESCRIPTION
The use of FLOS software and hardware is still not commonly used in bioanthropology to study of
human remains.
The objectives of the panel are to gather data on studies of archaeological human remains to point
out the usage of FLOS software and hardware (Vanni 2025; Larentis 2024; Vangeli 2013).
In particular, the papers will need to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of FLOS usage
from different viewpoints (e.g., economical, reducing error and time, and ease of use) in relation to
the shown specific case.
We request case studies in bioanthropology and related disciplines which highlight the role of
FLOS, but not limited to, in the following topics:
- grave studies
- palaeopathology
- dissemination and teaching
- 3D collections
The panel has already received commitment from tree speakers willing to present their case studies,
ensuring a content-rich session


## FLOS AND ORGANIC REMAINS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT

DESCRIPTION
The analysis of the organic remains found in archaeological contexts (such as bones and plant
elements) helps to paint a picture of the ancient population’s environment and lifestyle.
Picking up these elements from the soil and studying them are actions supporting the increasing use
of digital technologies, optimising data collection.
For example, since the 90s, Virtual Anthropology has focused on digitize bones, study of 3D
images, geometric morphometric, reconstruct and study 3D models in the bioanthropology field: all
this allows for the quantitative analysis of biological size and shape, the non-invasive studies of
internal bone areas, permanent availability (24/7), less handling of the material, favouring more
ethical approaches for the study, the conservation, and the usability of the material (Weber 2011,
2014). In the same way, this happens in other fields such as archaeozoology and paleobotany
(Spyrou et al 2022; Manzollino et al, 2024).
However, the use of FLOS hardware and software is not widespread (Mazzucchi et al 2024; Orsi et
al 2024a; Orsi et al 2024b; Taglioretti et al 2021; Carew et al 2019; Mazzucchi et al 2018;
Bankhead et al 2017).
The objective of the panel is to provide an overview of the use of FLOS tools during the excavation
and the analysis of the organic archaeological remains (including, e.g., prints, cast, pathological
elements, dental calculus) in the fields of bioanthropology, archaeozoology and archaeobotany, for
the morphological study of dental calculus, and for the biomolecular analysis of aDNA, isotopes,
and paleoproteomics.
We are inviting papers about, issues, advantages and disadvantages, state of art, and strategies for
promoting the us of FLOS hardware and software in the following topics (but not only):
- methodological research
- excavation and recovery
- ethics and FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and CARE (Collective
benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, Ethics)
- dissemination and gamification
- 3D printing
- 3D collection
The panel has already received commitment from four speakers willing to present their case studies,
ensuring a content-rich session.

Description
The widespread adoption of High-Density Survey and Measurement (HDSM)
technologies1 is transforming archaeological excavation, enabling researchers to
engage more fully with the volumetric dimension of stratigraphic data. While it is now
possible to respond to Roosevelt’s call to “think digitally as well as spatially and,
specifically, volumetrically”2, the transition to fully integrated 3D-based workflows
remains incomplete. Obstacles include the high costs of hardware, software
limitations, the complexity of processing tools, and the lack of shared best practices
and standards for acquisition, integration, and dissemination.
This panel welcomes contributions presenting workflows for the acquisition,
processing, and dissemination of 3D data, with a particular emphasis on solutions
based on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). By fostering discussion and
comparison, we aim to identify common challenges and explore innovative strategies
that can shape the future of 3D data management in archaeological practice

Description
Following an initial wave of enthusiasm, marked by the widespread application of GIS-
based geospatial and geostatistical analyses to predictive modelling1, digital
archaeology has entered a more methodologically refined phase. Researchers have
moved beyond broad-scale models to explore more nuanced, multiscalar approaches,
both at macro and micro levels.
Recent advances in the quality and accessibility of topographic data, along with the
development of increasingly sophisticated geospatial and geostatistical tools and
software, have enabled the integration of diverse analytical methods. Ten years ago,
Armando De Guio called this approach postdictive archaeology2, tracing the historical
path from the predictive modelling of the 1990s to the most recent approaches, often
culminating in the generation of predictive maps indicating areas of high archaeological
potential.
Analytical techniques such as Least Cost Path Analysis (LCPA) and viewshed analysis are
no longer limited to binary outcomes. Instead, they now incorporate varying degrees of
uncertainty, enhancing their heuristic value and offering a renewed perspective on the
possibilities of predictive modelling in archaeological research3.
This panel welcomes contributions presenting different geospatial and geostatistical
analyses in Landscape Archaeology, with a focus on the settlement pattern modelling,
archaeological potential mapping, site recognition, and ground truthing, with a
particular emphasis on solutions based on Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
