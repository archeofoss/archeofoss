**Panel: GIS open source solution for archaeological context in between Universities, Public Administration, societies, research center: pyArchInit case.**

During the latest fieldwork season (November 2021 - March 2022), the 
_Missione Archeologica della Sapienza nella Penisola Arabica e nel Golfo_ (MASPAG) 
launched a new archaeological survey in central Oman directed by Marco Ramazzotti and 
coordinated on field by Guido Antinori, in an area of the Al Batinah South Governorate 
unknown to archaeology, where a landscape archaeology project was initiated combining 
remote-sensing and ground verification activities. This operation also saw the first 
result of the collaboration between the MASPAG research group 
(survey coordination Marco Ramazzotti and excavation coordination by Francesco Genchi) and the 
company adArte srl (Luca Mandolesi and Enzo Cocca are partners in the company and responsible 
for the development of the pyArchInit platform): just as the first season of the survey served 
to estimate the archaeological potential of the area, its preparation became an important 
workshop to discuss open-source solutions in archaeological contexts (whether stratigraphic 
excavations or archaeological landscapes) and dialogue between universities and private companies. 
From the first meetings, the potential of implementing pyArchInit in MASPAG's documentation 
system clearly emerged, however, we highlighted the need to expand the existing system 
to meet the scientific ambition of our archaeological survey, i.e. documenting data collection 
not only from a stratigraphic excavation but from an archaeological landscape. 
Finding a way to implement this function, not yet developed in the plug-in, was the 
first and major point of discussion that prompted us to experiment with the basic 
functionalities of QGIS, aiming to build a geodatabase with descriptive tables of the 
surveyâ€™s transects and areas, the Topographical Units (TU) recognized in them and their 
archaeological features. The resulting tool was intended as a beta version, which was positively 
field-tested by the survey team - using the QFIELD plug-in for data input directly in the field. 
The next step, will be the concrete integration of pyArchInit with MASPAG's documentation system, which 
will lead to a twofold objective: the company will be able to extend the reach of the pyArchInit 
platform with a landscape documentation tool, while at the same time, the Sapienza team will have 
the pyArchInit platform available for all scientific documentation, from survey to excavation. 
The experimental nature of the collaboration, in fact, has perfectly matched the spirit and prospects 
of Sapienza's activities in Oman: the imminent closure of the excavation of the monumental 
necropolis of Daba al-Bayah (Grandi Scavi Sapienza program from 2019), will open up the possibility 
of launching a new series of field activities, the Batinah survey being the first example to be 
followed by others, including the possible stratigraphic excavation of the Shokur site in the oasis of 
Dank - az-Zahira governorate. These new perspectives, fully endorsed by our partner adArte, have given 
us the opportunity to establish a collaboration with the company that we're sure will lead to some very 
important scientific results, on the one hand, but has also demonstrated how the collaboration 
between university and private companies can be worthwhile.
