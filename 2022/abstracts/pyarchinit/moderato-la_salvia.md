In the framework of the project 'Castelseprio centre of power', the authors began excavating the structure known as Casa Torre in 2021. The area, already investigated by Piccoli in the 1970s, presents itself as an interesting case study for the application of an open and integrated solution for the management of stratigraphic data, specifically pyarchinit.

Since this is a university excavation and therefore characterised by both research and training purposes, it was decided to progressively and incrementally include the use of pyarchinit within the documentation protocols on site and post-excavation, spread over three years. The excavation is in fact attended by master's degree students who, at the end of the planned period, will have the basic skills to use the plugin also in a professional environment. At the end of the first two years of implementation, a SWOT analysis will show the results obtained within the site for both training and research purposes.
