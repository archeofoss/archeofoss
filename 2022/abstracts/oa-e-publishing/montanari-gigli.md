Huge platforms are amazing and yet problematic. Installing a local setup for a common tool such as Wikibase and Mediawiki or other platforms can be time consuming and complex as well as not in topic for the work you should point at. For this problem there are two solutions. The first is consultancy, that requires a very rare resource: money. The latter is trying to find ways to avoid costly infrastructures. 

Working in a direction of static data management is a completely different approach and requires a lot of methodological changes in the work we do in a day-to-day basis. We have no longer records or databases, but csv files and MarkDown descriptors. We no longer have uploads but a local version we can check and fast websites with, sadly, sometimes limited functionalities.

The paper analyzes several state of the art solutions in open source static data publishing platforms, such as 
- [CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh), a digital collection managed via MarkDownand a similar approach is the one made with 
- [GeoContext](https://github.com/openhistorymap/geocontext-front) for geographic information
and more, expliciting the upsides and downsides of every solution and expores how these can be part of a complex network of services.
