What is published data used for? And how do we make data relevant outside of DA? How do we make public history about a time that is so far in the past that it becomes complex to really grasp the meaning of "communication"? How do we make the world understandable to users that 

This presentation will cover FantasyMaps, a tool made using the infrastructure of OpenHistoryMap that maps out fantasy worlds, and its main and most appealing applicaiton, FoundryVTT OFM-Map-Canvas, a tool to have role players play in reconstructed fantasy worlds, modern day world or the world of the past, based (in the last case) on real archaeological and historical reconstructions.
