The proposal aims to present the results of a project for the digital enhancement of a group of roman
sculptures exposed into the Lilibeo Archeological Museum in Marsala. Aim of the project was define an
experimental system for the visualization and dissemination of the results achieved merging iconographical
studies, archaeological data and 3D reconstruction technologies. The methodology, developed by
specialists in archaeology, fine arts history, surveying and 3D modeling, involves the 3D data acquisition,
the 3D modeling and the implementation of an online visualization system.

The 3D visualization system was based on the ATON framework developed by CNR ISPC: it allows users to
interact with objects and 3D scenes using common web browsers and robust web standards. ATON offers a
wide variety of tools to manipulate 3D scenes together with a scalable rendering system with responsive
interfaces for accessing images, 3D models and descriptive focuses, ideal for comparison between
reconstructed and not reconstructed 3D models, that can be manipulated and visualized independently by
the users.

In the case of the Lilibeo Archeological Museum, the result was a first “Digital Archive” of sculptures
containing multi-language forms with focus per each artwork, combining descriptive data to the 3D models.
Sculptures enhancement was conducted using hypertext and multimedia content, like 3D models,
accessible through personal devices such as smartphone, tablet and personal computer, inside or outside
the museum areas. When the 3D object was selected, ATON firstly leads to a description popup, then to the reconstructed model and finally to the original 3D model, accompanying the user to the object
knowledge through multiple levels of in-depth information. Using virtual reality it was also able to offer a
captivating and more attractive visiting experience, integrating the traditional paneling. This system has
proven to be particularly effective in increasing the dissemination of information about the findings both
onsite and online and can be considered as a solution that can be easily used by different cultural
institutions (e.g., museums and archaeological areas).
