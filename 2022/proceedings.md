## Conference proceedings

The proceedings of the 2022 edition of ArcheoFOSS conference will be published in 2023 as a special issue of [Archeologia e Calcalotari (AeC)](http://www.archcalc.cnr.it/).

Papers must not exceed **3.000** words in length (bibliography included) and can contain a maximum of **5 figures**.

A (still) unofficial [Citation Style Language file](archeologia-e-calcolatori.csl) to use with Zotero to correctly format citations and bibliography. The file has been developed by Stefano Costa and Marco Moderato and has been submitted to the staff of Archeologia e Calcolatori for review. [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/) allows automating the formatting of citations and bibliographies.

The official editorial guidelines for authors are available [in PDF format](AeC-editorial-guidelines.pdf).
