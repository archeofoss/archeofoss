## Conference proceedings

The proceedings of the 16<sup>th</sup> edition of ArcheoFOSS conference will be published in 2023 as a special issue of [Archeologia e Calcalotari (AEC)](http://www.archcalc.cnr.it/).


A (still) unofficial [CSL (Citation Style Language)](https://citationstyles.org/) file to use with [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to correctly format citations and bibliography. The file has been developed by [Stefano Costa](mailto:steko@iosa.it) and [Marco Moderato](mailto:marco.moderato@gmail.com) and has been submitted to the staff of Archeologia e Calcolatori for review.

The official editorial guidelines for authors are available at [archcalc.cnr.it/pages/guidelines.php](http://www.archcalc.cnr.it/pages/guidelines.php).
